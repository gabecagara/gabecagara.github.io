    <h1>Howdy, I'm Gabe!</h1>
    <p>Quick blurb about me: I am a traveling bug, who loves to restaurant 
        hop and to make people laugh everyday. 
        I also make it a goal to do something INSANE every summer 
        ~ skydive, swim with sharks, ride a helicopter etc. Needless to say, 
        I'm a little bit of a thrill seeker who is a sucker for food,
         design, and hardwork. </p>
